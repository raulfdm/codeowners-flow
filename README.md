# CodeOwners JS
> Manage your CODEOWNERS file programmatically.

## About

The `CODEOWNERS` strategy is employed by version control platforms (e.g., Github, Azure, Gitlab, etc.) to specify which parts of the repository are owned by particular teams or individuals. This is extremely beneficial for notifying the rightful owners in Pull Requests when their code is altered.

The `CODEOWNERS` file uses its own unique syntax, where:

- `#` will be threated as a comment;
- `<pattern> <team|user>`, where:
  - pattern so the platform can "match" the files (e.g., `*` for everything, `apps/backend` will match the `backend` folder inside `apps`, etc.)
- `<team|user>` a list of teams or users that will be owner of that code. It can be a list separated by space.

For example:

```
# Fallback maintainers
* @company/core-team

# Backend core
apps/backend @company/backend-core

# Backend API
apps/backend-endpoint @company/microservices @company/backend-core
```

Challenges arise when dozens of teams work within the same codebase and there's a need for precise ownership distribution among them.

For instance, let's consider a scenario where you want to designate a "default team ownership." For each rule, you would not only have to assign the specific owner of that piece of code but also the default team. The configuration might look something like this:

```
* @company/core-team

apps/backend @company/backend-core @company/core-team

apps/front-end @company/web-core @company/core-team

packages/analytics @company/data-analytics @company/core-team
```


In this example, for every `CODEOWNERS` pattern, we manually added `@company/core-team`. Now, think about a situation where you decide that two or more teams should act as the "default maintainers." You'd have to update every single entry to add these new teams.

The crux of the problem: maintaining a comprehensive `CODEOWNERS` file can become tedious and error-prone.

What if there was a way to script the `CODEOWNERS` file? What if you could leverage JavaScript to define these rules and generate the file?

That's where this tool comes in. It empowers teams to script code ownership rules using basic JavaScript and then produces a file that can be interpreted by the platforms.
