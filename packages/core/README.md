## About

`codeowners-flow` lets you manage your CODEOWNERS file programmatically.

Instead of directly creating and maintaining the CODEOWNERS markup file, with `codeowners-flow` you can define your code owners rules in JavaScript. This allows you to automatically generate the final file based on this configuration.

To understand the motivations behind this project, refer to the [root repository README](../../README.md).

## Getting started

The first step is to install `codeowners-flow` in your project:

> **Important**
> If you're using a monorepo, every step should be executed at the root level.

```bash
# or npm/yarn
pnpm add codeowners-flow
```

Next, create a file named `codeowners.config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  outDir: '.github',
  rules: [
    {
      patterns: ['*'],
      owners: [
        {
          name: '@company/team',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

After that, you can run the CLI:

```bash
npx codeowners-flow generate
```

The CLI will read your configuration and generate a CODEOWNERS file in the specified `outDir``:

**.github/CODEOWNERS**

```
# This file was generated automatically by codeowners-flow. Do not edit it manually.
# Instead, modify the `codeowners.config.mjs` file located at the root of your project.

# -------------------- START -------------------- #
## Matching patterns...
* @company/team
# -------------------- END -------------------- #

```

## Config

### outDir

##### excludePatterns

Type: `string[] | undefined`\
Default: `undefined`

A list of patterns to exclude.

```
# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`

# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
/apps/ @octocat
/apps/github # <- exclude pattern
```

#### comments
