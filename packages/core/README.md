## About

`codeowners-flow` allow you to manage your CODEOWNERS file in a programatically way.

Instead creating and maintaining directly the CODEOWNERS markup file, with `codeowners-flow` you'll be able to
define your codeowners rules in JavaScript and automatically generate the final file based on this configuration.

To know more about the motivations, check the [root repository README](../../README.md).

## Getting started

First step is installing `codeowners-flow` in your project:

> **Important**
> In case you're using a monorepo, every step should be added in the root level

```bash
# or npm/yarn
pnpm add codeowners-flow
```

Now, create a file called `codeowners.config.mjs`:

```js
export default {
  outDir: '.github',
  rules: [
    {
      patterns: ['*'],
      owners: [
        {
          name: '@company/team',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

Now, you can call the CLI:

```bash
npx codeowners-flow generate
```

The CLI will read your configuration and generate a `CODEOWNERS` file the specificied `outDir`:

**.github/CODEOWNERS**

```codeowners
# This file was generated automatically by codeowners-flow. Do not edit it manually.
# Instead, change the `codeowners.config.mjs` file in the root of your project.

# -------------------- START -------------------- #
## Matching patterns...
* @company/team
# -------------------- END -------------------- #
```
